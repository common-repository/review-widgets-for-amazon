The Amazon Reviews WordPress Widget plugin is for showing off your best Amazon customer reviews on your website with a variety of customizable widgets.

While it may seem just like a visually appealing way to spruce up your website, including a widget with Amazon reviews can be much more than that.

How?

Well, by showing off your top Amazon reviews through a stylized widget that you’ve personalized to your brand’s image, you can develop social proof for your business. Social proof is one of those key concepts in business that can help your sales soar and interest in your goods skyrocket.

### Why are Amazon reviews so important?

Social proof is simply what you get when you have plenty of positive feedback and reviews about your business. It’s what convinces potential new customers who are on the fence about choosing your business to go with you over the competition. After all, all new customers want to know is what previous customers have to say about interacting with the business.

Real people want to hear from real people, and it’s not because customers perceive all business owners as evil, but because customers who’ve had experience with the business can be trusted more easily.

Amazon reviews can be critical for the growth of your business given that it’s one of the largest online retailers on the market.

If you don’t have a lot of reviews yet, you’ll need to start collecting some. All you need to do is create a link customers can use to leave a review on Amazon, and then attach it in your email and social media interactions with your existing customer base.
